### 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Ashley Esau** — a curious and grounded data professional passionate about solving real problems with clean pipelines, thoughtful models, and scalable infrastructure.

- I transitioned from scripting surveys and cleaning data in market research to diving deep into **data engineering**.
- I'm focused on **building strong technical foundations** in data modeling, distributed systems, and analytics tooling.
- I value **craftsmanship** — mastering the tools I use and developing original style rather than just copying tutorials.
- I’m driven by the desire for **independence, creativity, and clarity** in my work — building systems that last and that feel purposeful.

### My Philosophy

> *"Craftsmanship isn’t about perfection. It’s about intention, mastery, and presence."*

I want my career to reflect **depth over breadth**, and my work to feel **intentional, resilient, and real**. I believe in small, consistent improvements — and that a well-designed data pipeline is a quiet kind of art.
