### ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, I'm **Ashley Esau** â€” a curious and grounded data professional passionate about solving real problems with clean pipelines, thoughtful models, and scalable infrastructure.

- I transitioned from scripting surveys and cleaning data in market research to diving deep into **data engineering**.
- I absolutely love **teamwork** and the **community** of working with other business professionals to drive an organization forward.
- I'm focused on **building strong technical foundations** in data modeling, distributed systems, and analytics tooling.
- I value **craftsmanship** â€” mastering the tools I use and developing original style rather than just copying tutorials.

### Areas I'm Focused On

- **Data Engineering** â€“ building pipelines, orchestrating workflows, and handling messy data at scale  
- **Analytics Engineering** â€“ modeling clean, intuitive datasets for downstream users with tools like dbt  
- **Fintech** â€“ especially infrastructure/data platforms in modern payments and lending companies

### Recent Project: NYC Parking Tickets Data Model

I've been working on a dimensional modeling project using **NYC Parking Tickets** data to sharpen my data engineering skills and apply dbt in a practical context.

**GitHub**: [ashleyesau/parking_tickets](https://github.com/ashleyesau/parking_tickets)

- Designed a **star schema** with a central fact table and four dimension tables: `date`, `vehicle`, `officer`, and `violation`
- Implemented the model using **dbt**, focusing on clarity, reusability, and performance
- Wrote tests and documentation to support data quality and downstream usability
- Learned to navigate messy real-world datasets and make design decisions that balance flexibility with simplicity

This project is a reflection of my core values: **clean architecture, intentional design, and practical craftsmanship.**

### My Philosophy

> *"Craftsmanship isnâ€™t about perfection. Itâ€™s about intention, mastery, and presence."*

I want my career to reflect **depth over breadth**, and my work to feel **intentional, resilient, and real**. I believe in small, consistent improvements â€” and that a well-designed data pipeline is a quiet kind of art.
